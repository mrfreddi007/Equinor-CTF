NetworkX is intended to provide

-  Encoding and decoding Morse Code in
   default and binary encription,

-  More types of Encription,

-  Converting Morse Codes into sound signals,

-  Generating wave forms for the encoded signals.


The Python programming language
-------------------------------

Python is a powerful programming language that allows simple and flexible ways to deal with patterns and dictionaries. Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that Morse Talk can use to provide more features.

Most importantly, Python is free, well-supported, and a joy to use.
